# Typography

## Scale at breakpoints

We have seven possible sizes for type, numbered `0` to `6`, with `0` being the largest and `6` the smallest.

Each of these sizes is responsive, being largest at the large breakpoint, becoming smaller at the medium breakpoint and smaller still at the smallest breakpoint.

## Font families
