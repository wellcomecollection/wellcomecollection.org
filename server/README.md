# wellcomecollection.org server

The package that other webapps rely on to serve a common [KoaJS](http://koajs.com/) server,
and some common services, utils and tid-bits. We should be trimming this and splitting it up over time.

## Requirements
* [Node 8](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Yarn `brew install yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)

## Dev
```
# ensure you've yarn installed at the root directory, this is where we keep our devDependecies
yarn install
yarn run dev
```

This will run app with [`babel-node`](http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/cli/#babel-node), restarting the server
on file change to have your changes take effect.


## Build
```
yarn install
yarn run app:build
```

This will create a [`webpack`](https://webpack.js.org/) generated package of the app in the `.dist` folder.
Along with the JS file, we ship the [`./views`](./views) there too.


## Accessibility testing
```bash
npm run test:accessibility <url>
```

The test outputs 3 message types:

- **error** clear-cut guideline violations that must be fixed
- **warnings** items it identifies that require human verification to determine if guidelines are breached
- **notices** items the system can't detect that require human verification to determine if guidelines are breached

It is important to resolve/verify all 3 types in order to achieve standards compliance.
Additional guidance on manually checking warnings and can be found here:
https://github.com/wellcometrust/developer-docs/blob/master/front-end/accessibility/Webpage_Accessibility_Audit_Procedure.md


## Cross browser testing
```bash
npm run test:browsers <url>
```

The test opens your browser at browserstack.com with screenshots of the url in browsers we test on.
You can also click through to instances of those browsers.

In order for this to work need to add your browserstack credentials to 'browserstack/browserstack-config.json'
in the following format:

```json
{
  "username": "<browserstack_username>",
  "key": "browserstack_key"
}
```
