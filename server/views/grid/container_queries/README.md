Using the cell modifiers, we can reason about what proportion of the screen will be covered at different breakpoints.

Combining the breakpoint and cell modifier information, we can create pseudo *container queries* (also known as *element queries*), enabling components to take on different styles based on their size in the viewport, rather than the size of the viewport itself.

The `container-query()` mixin accepts a list of lists. The key to each inner list is the breakpoint at which the query will be applied _if_ the cell covers any of the number of columns specified.

For example:

```scss
container-query(('s': 1, 'm': 4, 'l': 8)) {
  // styles here will be applied when the component lives inside one of:
  // grid__cell--s1 or more and the viewport is  0px â€“ 599px wide
  // grid__cell--m1234 or more and the viewport is 600px - 959px wide
  // grid__cell--l12345678 or more and the viewport is > 960px wide
}
```

## SCSS in the example on this page
```scss
@include container-query(('s': 1)) {
  background: color('red');
}

@include container-query(('m': 5)) {
  background: color('orange');
}

@include container-query(('l': 3)) {
  background: color('yellow');
}
```
