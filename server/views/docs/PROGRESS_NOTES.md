# How we're improving search

We are working to make [wellcomecollection.org](https://wellcomecollection.org) a more welcoming space where you can discover more of what Wellcome Collection has to offer. As part of this work, we’re bringing together library collections, physical and digital alike, into a single location. Here you will be able to search, browse, read and do research across the breadth of Wellcome Library’s holdings.

We have a lot of work to do, and we’ve only just begun.

## What's changed?
You can now find more than 110,000 free to use and openly licensed images from our former picture library, Wellcome Images.

The first phase resulted in:

* A website and search that you can use on mobile devices
* A simpler way to download high resolution and low resolution images
* Zoom feature that allows you to see more detailed images
* Even more images licenced under Creative Commons licences, mostly CC-BY and CC0.

Throughout this first phase we’ve been collecting feedback on the website. Thanks to more than 200 respondents, we know that there are significant improvements to make search more effective, and to improve the quality of information about the items available on this website.

We’re listening.

## What's coming up?

In the first half of 2018, you can expect to see improvements to the search experience. We’ll focus on:

**Improving information about works**

* Joining up digital images with more complete information from the library catalogue
* Including information about the original object, such as its size, format, publication details, and so on
* Making reference numbers and citation information available and clear.

**Improving search and filtering**

* Dates and date ranges
* Filter by licence
* Search by subject, country of publication, media type.

**Improving how you can manage and share your search results**

* Ways to save groups of images or records
* Simple embed option to make it easy to use an image on another website.

For now, if you need any help in identifying items from library collections, please email collections@wellcome.ac.uk.

## Get involved
We want to share our work in progress with you, and to get your feedback throughout the development.

If you’d like to help shape how this website works, we invite you to join our User Panel. We're looking for people at all levels of research experience to participate in the design process.

As a panellist, you’ll be invited to take part in occasional activities which help us test new designs, functionality and features. These activities may be in-person interviews, brief interactive tests, and surveys. You do not be present in London to participate; many activities can be done online.

Interested? Please [complete this short survey](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/P6DRMHJ) so we can understand more about your interests and experience.
