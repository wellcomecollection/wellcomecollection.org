# Content model for Prismic

All models are created in TypeScript, and stored in Prismic as [custom types][custom-types].

We use the [Custom types API][custom-types-api] to deploy types into Prismic.

As these deploys could potentially take the website down, we deploy locally and not through CI.

To deploy a type:

    yarn deployType --id {custom_type_id}

You'll then be given a diff to validate, and deploy. We have no test environment for Prismic.

If you change [a part](./src/parts) included in multiple types, e.g. [`body`](./src/parts/body.ts),
you will have to remember to deploy all affected types.
