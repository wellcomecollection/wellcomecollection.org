/** This contains a list of values which are sent to Segment.
 *
 * == What it's used for ==
 *
 * These are used to analyse behaviour on the site, e.g. we use the 'source'
 * parameter on links to track where somebody clicked from, so we can see
 * how many people landed on concept pages from contributors/subjects/genres/etc.
 *
 * These types are an attempt to describe the expectations of those reporting tools;
 * to enforce our "analytics contract" in code.  It isn't set in stone, but it's
 * meant to flag to developers if they make unplanned or unexpected changes --
 * hopefully this will lead to fewer unintentional changes.
 *
 * If you want to change this type, check with our digital analyst (currently Tacey)
 * before you do -- so the change can be coordinated with their reports.
