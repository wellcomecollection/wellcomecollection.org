// This is microcopy on the site that's hard-coded, rather than fetched from Prismic.
//
// We try to keep it in one place for a few reasons:
//
//    - All this text can be reviewed for consistency
//    - It's easier for non-developers to work out if something is hard-coded, and isn't
//      something they can update on their own, e.g. if the Editorial team are wondering
//      why they can't update some text in Prismic.
//    - This file is simple enough that a non-developer with a GitHub account might be
//      able to edit it themselves, using the GitHub web interface.
