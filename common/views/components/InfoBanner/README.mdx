## Purpose
To provide distinct alert information at the top of the page.

### InfoBanner Default
The `InfoBanner` is generic and its content can be changed on Prismic, which is also where it's display status can be controlled.

### WebsiteIssues Banner
The `WebsiteIssuesBanner` is for when we need to warn our users about issues across the website. Prismic data might be unavailable as part of those issues and so we needed a hardcoded version to be able to communicate it to our users. It can be activated through one of our permanent Toggles.
