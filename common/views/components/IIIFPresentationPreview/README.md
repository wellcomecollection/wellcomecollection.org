## Purpose

To display a preview of the content described by a IIIF presentation manifest.

There are several different types of content that can be described by a IIIF presentation manifest and thus presented in the preview area:

- multi volume work
- single book
- audio
- video
- PDF
- none: something that isn't one of the above and we don't cater for
