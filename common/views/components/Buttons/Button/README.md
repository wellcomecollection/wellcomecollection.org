## Button
Used for functional call to action.

### Primary button
e.g. 'Book tickets' on Events page

Used for main call to action in a component or page.  
May include an icon to emphasise the function.  

### Primary supporting button
e.g. 'Cancel'

Used with 'Primary button' to provide supporting action.

### Secondary button
e.g. 'Download full size', 'Download small' and 'Copy Url' on Works page

Used to support multiple actions in a component.
Use icons to place more emphasise to one action over the rest or differentiate each action.

These will be called either as a `button` or an `a` element, based on whether a `url` prop is passed in.
