## Purpose
Button serves to offer one centralised component for all of our button types. Currently contains;

### Solid
Default button and is a button element.

### SolidLink
Looks exactly like ButtonSolid but is a link and needs a `link` property

### Dropdown
Button element that acts like a Select element. Takes children for its modal content.
