## Purpose

To create the impression the video embed from the body is included in the header area.

When an article has the `short film` format applied:

- The page header won't display a featured image
- The first element in the `Body` will have a split-tone background colour – white at the top, and cream at the bottom
- The `VideoEmbed` in the `Body` will span the full 12 columns of the grid.
