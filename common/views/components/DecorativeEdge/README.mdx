## Purpose
`WobblyEdge` creates a div that contains a random edge. It can be placed anywhere as it's an "as is" component.

`WobblyBottom` accepts children and places a `WobblyEdge` underneath them.

`WEdge` is a decorative edge in the shape of the top of our "W". It can be placed anywhere as it's an "as is" component.
