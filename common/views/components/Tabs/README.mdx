## Purpose
Tabs help organise and navigate related or similar types of content. They allow the user to change the view of groups of information that appear within the same context.

### Default
`Tabs.Switch` uses real tab behaviour where clicking a tab will swap out the content of the tabpanel underneath.

### Links
`Tabs.Navigate` uses the same styled-components as `Tabs.Switch`, but the tabs function as anchors which link to a new page.
