## Purpose
To display a text input and any relevant validation UI/messaging to the user.

### Notes
- The input will validate when it is blurred or the form it lives in is submitted (either shows error or success state)
- The input will hide any error at the point when it becomes valid and won't re-check for errors until it is blurred
- The input will hide valid checkmark if it receives new input and won't revalidate until it is blurred
