## Purpose
Some pages require a subnavigation to go through various categories. This can be used when the wanted behaviour is a simple navigation; see the [TabNav](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/wellcomecollection.org/edit/main/common/views/components/TabNav/README.md) component when you want a tabs behaviour instead.
