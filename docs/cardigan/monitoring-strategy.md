# Monitoring

Monitoring things that are important to us allows us to move forward quickly and confidently.

Monitoring should:
* Clearly let us know if we are succeeding or failing
* Let us know if we have any faults that need attending (alerting)

## What do we monitor?

> Key results should be quantifiable, achievable, lead to objective grading and be difficult, but not impossible.

These metrics should give us confidence that what we're working on is delivering value
as defined by the [team's objectives](#) (Document TBC).

### [Health](http://ghp.wellcomecollection.org/speedtracker/)
Alerting is key to health metrics.

Having metrics allow us to release fast and often by letting us know as
soon as possible that our product is unhealthy. A healthy system is a quiet system.

We should also be able to diagnose where repeated unhealthy spots are to
retrospectively go back and put more permanent solutions.

This will ultimately mean more time on new features rather than maintaining

### Performance
Performance of our platform and the components it's comprised of are key to user satisfaction.

This could be the speed at which the platform delivers content to a user, or the metrics of
whether a specific component is being used.

These metrics should allow us to improve or fix areas we deem worth keeping, or culling
others that aren't performing.
