# RFC 001: URL Parameter Strategy

**Last updated: March 2018.**

## Background
After discussions of creating a URL strategy, and documents to help support
sticking to that strategy in the future, we thought a good starting point could
be where we have a use case - URL parameters.


## Problem statement
URL parameters are used for storing information needed to render a page, such
as a query, or page number.

They are also other reasons you might want to store parameters in the URL, such
as application state, user preferences, display logic etc.

With the latter, there are considerations in clarity, sharing, immutability and
privacy.


# Proposed solution
We come up with a strategy document, potentially to become part of a greater
URL strategy document, to guide us when we are thinking of using URL parameters.

[Example document](../../docs/url_parameters_strategy.md)
