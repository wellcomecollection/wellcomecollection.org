# Introduction

This GitBook space is meant to explain the ideas behind the Wellcome Collection website, so staff can continue to develop and improve it.

This includes:

* Walkthrough guides of complex features
* Design documents that explain why we did something in a particular way
* Notes on possible future improvements, and why we haven't done them yet

It does **not** contain specific operational details, e.g. how to deploy specific services.
Those are kept inside the code repository.

## Repo

The front-end code is in the [wellcomecollection/wellcomecollection.org](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/wellcomecollection.org) repo.
