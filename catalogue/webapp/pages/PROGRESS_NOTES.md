# Our beta collections search
Our collections search is currently in beta, which means we’re developing the service in public for our users. It’s a work in progress, and subject to change based on your feedback and testing. 

As part of this work, we will bring together library collections, physical and digital alike, into a single place. Here you will be able to search, browse, read and do research across the whole Wellcome library catalogue.

We will keep this page up to date with the latest information as we make more progress. 

## What’s new? (updated March 2019)
You can now:
* Search for and see our single-volume books and pamphlets in a new book viewer
* Search for digitised artworks, plus images from the insides of books, manuscripts and other visual material
* Download images and PDFs
*	Narrow your search to include either books or visual material
*	Use the search and view items more easily on mobile devices.

### What are the limits?
*	You may get too many results that are irrelevant to your initial search
*	Some library catalogue data is not available yet, so there may be very little information associated with some images or not be enough information to identify the item you’re looking at. 
*	Some images lack references to the item from which they were taken. 
*	Our archives, manuscripts, audio, video, journals and multi-volume books are not available yet.
*	No date filtering available yet. 

If you think something might be missing, or want a more comprehensive search, please try searching the catalogue on [wellcomelibrary.org](https://wellcomelibrary.org) in the meantime. 

For now, if you need any additional help in identifying items from library collections, please email collections@wellcome.ac.uk.

## What’s next:
Next we’ll be working to improve the relevance of your search results. We’re also working on improving the descriptive data, physical details and location information, and the data that allows you to filter your search by year. 

# Get involved
We want to share our work in progress with you, and to get your feedback throughout the development.

If you’d like to help shape how this website works, we invite you to join our User Panel. We’re looking for people at all levels of research experience to participate in the design process.

As a panellist, you’ll be invited to take part in occasional activities which help us test new designs, functionality and features. These activities may be in-person interviews, brief interactive tests, and surveys. You do not need to be present in London to participate; many activities can be done online.

Interested? Please [complete this short survey](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/P6DRMHJ) so we can understand more about your interests and experience.
