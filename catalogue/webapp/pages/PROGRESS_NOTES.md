# Our beta collections search
Our collections search is currently in beta, which means we’re developing the service in public for our users. It’s a work in progress, and subject to change based on your feedback and testing.

As part of this work, we will bring together library collections, physical and digital alike, into a single place. Here you will be able to search, browse, read and do research across the whole Wellcome library catalogue.

For a more comprehensive search of all of our collections, [wellcomelibrary.org](https://wellcomelibrary.org) is still available. There you can search the library and archive catalogues for complete coverage of the collections and their data.

We will keep this page up to date with the latest information as we make more progress.

## What’s new? (updated June 2019)

We made it easier to get an overview of a book's content and review individual pages in detail. We are currently working to improve the relevance of your search results which will be released shortly.

You can now:
* Browse all pages at a glance to get a sense of the book
* Get to the individual pages quickly
* Download an image or PDF while viewing the item
* Get the same viewing experience for books and images
* Easily navigate an item with keyboard controls
* Use screen reader software to listen to the text contained in images
* View items more easily on mobile devices

### What are the limits?
*	You may get too many results that are irrelevant to your initial search
*	Some library catalogue data is not available yet, so there may be very little information associated with some images or not be enough information to identify the item you’re looking at.
*	Some images lack references to the item from which they were taken.
*	Our archives, manuscripts, audio, video, journals and multi-volume books are not available yet.
*	No date filtering available yet.

If you think something might be missing, or want a more comprehensive search, please try searching the catalogue on [wellcomelibrary.org](https://wellcomelibrary.org) in the meantime.

For now, if you need any additional help in identifying items from library collections, please email collections@wellcome.ac.uk.

## What’s next:
Next we’ll be working to improve the relevance of your search results. We’re also working on improving the descriptive data, physical details and location information, and the data that allows you to filter your search by year. We will be making more items available including audio, video and multi-volume books.

# Get involved
We want to share our work in progress with you, and to get your feedback throughout the development.

If you’d like to help shape how this website works, we invite you to join our User Panel. We’re looking for people at all levels of research experience to participate in the design process.

As a panellist, you’ll be invited to take part in occasional activities which help us test new designs, functionality and features. These activities may be in-person interviews, brief interactive tests, and surveys. You do not need to be present in London to participate; many activities can be done online.

Interested? Please [fill out this form](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/P6DRMHJ) so we understand more about your interests and can get in touch with you.
