  or a [`bug`](https://github.com/wellcometrust/wellcomecollection.org/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug).
* Again, [a good PR](https://github.com/blog/1943-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request)
  goes a long way
* Leverage our [internal process](#internal-process) for clarity and organisation where you can.
