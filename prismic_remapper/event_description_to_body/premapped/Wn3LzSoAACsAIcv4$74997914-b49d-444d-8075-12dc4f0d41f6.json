How does colonialism play a role in what is seen as healthy in our society? How do the colonial origins of science persist in medical teaching, research and global health? What does it mean to decolonise a museums’ medical collections and practices?\nJoin us for a day of conversations about decolonising health in society, science and museums.</p></a></div>"
