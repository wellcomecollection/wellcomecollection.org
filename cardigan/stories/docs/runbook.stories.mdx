# Monitoring

We use a combination of methods to let us monitor the health of our system.

## Health and performance
The health and performance of our system is monitored by a number of dashboards.

* [Speedtracker](http://ghp.wellcomecollection.org/speedtracker/)
* [Datastudio](https://datastudio.google.com)
* Application bundle size

# Troubleshooting
We run on a **roll forward** methodology, trying to fix and improve the site
rather than roll back.

However, if core functionality is at stake, **rolling back** is the quickest way
to relieve pressure, so that we can roll forward.

## Rolling back
We can roll back to any Docker container we have built. You can find the Docker
containers publicly hosted on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/wellcome/).

To roll back, find the docker container you need<sup>*</sup>, then run
[`./deploy/terraform_deploy_service.sh <SERVICE_NAME> <DOCKER_CONTAINER_TAG>`](../deploy).

Once rolled back, we can start diagnosing the problem.

<sup>*</sup> The process here still needs work, as we have no way of indicating
the last docker build we considered healthy.

## Diagnosing the problem

If the error was from CloudWatch, we store the logs locally in S3,
go into Athena, and run the `ALB Logging - create` saved query, followed by
`5xx errors` saved query. You should be able to spot the location of the error
from there<sup>**</sup>.

<sup>**</sup> These should be saved in terraform, but currently aren't.

# Testing
