# Page types

__There are six page types__
- [Section pages](#section-pages)
- [List pages](#list-pages)
- [Landing pages](#landing-pages)
- [Series pages](#series-pages)
- [Content pages](#content-pages)
- [Season pages](#season-pages)


## Section pages
A section page is a linked page from the main navigation. Each section page provides an overview of the content contained within the section and enables users to link to the deeper content. This is achieved through a combination of brief introductory text, cards and can include custom functionality e.g. [What's on](https://wellcomecollection.org/whats-on) filters or [Collections](https://wellcomecollection.org/collections) search tool.

### Examples of Section pages
- [Visit us](https://wellcomecollection.org/visit-us)
- [What's on](https://wellcomecollection.org/whats-on)
- [Stories](https://wellcomecollection.org/stories)
- [Collections](https://wellcomecollection.org/collections)
- [What we do](https://wellcomecollection.org/what-we-do)


#### Core components
- [Regular cards](https://cardigan.wellcomecollection.org/?path=/story/components--eventpromo)
- [Banner cards](https://cardigan.wellcomecollection.org/?path=/story/components--bannercard)
- [Featured cards](https://cardigan.wellcomecollection.org/?path=/story/components--featuredcard)


## List pages
List pages display cards for all content of the same type, usually linked to from a [CTA button](https://cardigan.wellcomecollection.org/?path=/story/components--buttonoutlined) e.g. `View all exhibitions` from [What's on](https://wellcomecollection.org/whats-on) or `More articles` from [Stories](https://wellcomecollection.org/stories).

### Examples of List pages
- [Articles](https://wellcomecollection.org/articles)

- [Past events](https://wellcomecollection.org/events/past?availableOnline=true)
- [Books](https://wellcomecollection.org/books)


#### Core components

- [Book promo cards](https://cardigan.wellcomecollection.org/?path=/story/components--bookpromo) (on Books list page only)


## Landing pages
Landing pages summarise a single topic area and link to relevant content using a two-way parent child relationship (the child being *part of* its parent). They can also be used to describe an explicit content grouping.

### Examples of Landing pages
- [Venue hire](https://wellcomecollection.org/pages/Wuw2MSIAACtd3SsC)
- [About us](https://wellcomecollection.org/pages/Wuw2MSIAACtd3Stq)

- [Compact cards](https://cardigan.wellcomecollection.org/?path=/story/components--compactcard)
- [Banner cards](https://cardigan.wellcomecollection.org/?path=/story/components--bannercard) (when using Season type)

## Series pages
A Series or Serial page summarises and collects together content from either an *event series* or a *story series/serial*

### Examples of Series pages
[The heart of homesickness](https://wellcomecollection.org/series/X24JnhEAAMplRFYN)

#### Serial page
- [Inside Our Collections](https://wellcomecollection.org/series/WsSUrR8AAL3KGFPF)

- [Regular cards](https://cardigan.wellcomecollection.org/?path=/story/components--eventpromo)
- [Compact cards](https://cardigan.wellcomecollection.org/?path=/story/components--compactcard)

## Content pages
Content pages are built around a single column and are optimised for reading. Images are displayed inline and compact [Cards ](https://www.notion.so/Cards-e54ea58927164b03becec024ecbeabda)  are used within the core content to encourage a natural vertical direction. They can be grouped under a *Landing page* to establish a *part of* relationship and longer pages with more than three heading may use an [Anchor list](https://www.notion.so/Anchor-list-256805de828048d69b3d98420cc62ae6) to give visibility and access to content without needing to first scroll.

### Examples of content pages

## Season pages
Seasons bring together Wellcome Collection programmed and online content around a theme, and are presented to the public as a programme of WC activity that takes place over a specific amount of time.

A Season page contains a summary and links to the various content types using [Cards ](https://www.notion.so/Cards-e54ea58927164b03becec024ecbeabda)

### Example of a Season page
[What does it mean to be human, now?](https://wellcomecollection.org/seasons/X84FvhIAACUAqiqp)

#### Core components

- [EventPromo](https://cardigan.wellcomecollection.org/?path=/story/components--eventpromo)


## To do
- *Anatomy of a page*
    In Prismic-land, a ‘slice’ is a thing that can contain multiple ‘zones’, and each of those zones can contain different bits of content. And there can be any number of these zones in any order. Then when we retrieve this slice from prismic, we can take each of the zones, and decide how to render them (i.e. what component to use).

    We make most use of this in the [`Body`](https://cardigan.wellcomecollection.org/?path=/story/components--body), which is comprised of a slice that we get from Prismic, that has multiple zones.

- *Attempt at showing the relationships (needs Seasons)*
