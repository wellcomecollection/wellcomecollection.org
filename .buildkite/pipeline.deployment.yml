    # These three lines create a "lock" around this pipeline.

    # This means that once a deployment starts to an environment,
    # no other builds will deploy to that environment until this
    # deployment is complete and has run the end-to-end tests.

    # == How it works ==
    #
    # This uses the "concurrency gate" pattern described in the Buildkite blog
    # here: https://buildkite.com/blog/concurrency-gates
    #
    # Once this job starts running, this build has to either:
    #
    #   1)  fail, or
    #   2)  complete all the other tasks in this concurrency group -- which is
    #       just the "Complete!" task at the end of the pipeline
    #
    # before any other build is allowed to run tasks in this concurrency group.
    # This means no other build can start a new deployment until this deployment
    # is complete.
    #
    # Note: we have separate concurrency groups for stage/prod, because it's okay
    # to deploy to them both simultaneously.
