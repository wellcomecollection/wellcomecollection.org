// This is copy for the identity web app that's hard-coded, rather than fetched from Prismic.
//
// It's longer than microcopy so it doesn't live in the microcopy file (microcopy.ts), but
// we keep it in one place for similar reasons:
//
//    - All this text can be reviewed for consistency
//    - It's easier for non-developers to work out if something is hard-coded, and isn't
//      something they can update on their own, e.g. if the Editorial team are wondering
//      why they can't update some text in Prismic.
