The thing that makes the Wellcome Collection available to the public.

## Requirements

* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (or use [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))


The project is split into multiple services, follow the `README`s within each project to get started.

* [client](./client)
  Static assets such as SASS, JS, fonts etc. Responsible for their compilation.

* [server](./server)
  Runs the server that returns the HTML templates, components and Fractal styleguide

* [infra](./infra)

## Editor settings

Be aware that the Sass (`.stylelintrc`) and JS (`.eslintrc.json`) lint config files – and their node module dependencies – are contained within the `client` directory. You should configure your editor to resolve the correct node modules path in order for linting to work with your editor open at the root of the project.
