This project works best if you have compiled the [static](../static) project into the
`../dist` folder as we reference those files in the HTML.


## Dev

```bash
npm install
npm run app:dev
```

If you get this error when running `app`:

```
Error: Cannot find module '../config/css-assets.json'
```

You need to compile the assets [in the client directory](../client).


## Prod (uses PM2)

```bash
npm install
npm run app:run
#Â Or in a docker
npm run app:docker
```

## Accessibility testing

```bash
npm run test:accessibility <url>
```

The test outputs 3 message types:

- **error** clear-cut guideline violations that must be fixed
- **warnings** items it identifies that require human verification to determine if guidelines are breached
- **notices** items the system can't detect that require human verification to determine if guidelines are breached

It is important to resolve/verify all 3 types in order to achieve standards compliance.
Additional guidance on manually checking warnings and can be found here:
https://github.com/wellcometrust/developer-docs/blob/master/front-end/accessibility/Webpage_Accessibility_Audit_Procedure.md


## Cross browser testing

```bash
npm run test:browsers <url>
```

The test opens your browser at browserstack.com with screenshots of the url in browsers we test on.
You can also click through to instances of those browsers.

In order for this to work need to add your browserstack credentials to 'browserstack/browserstack-config.json'
in the following format:

```json
{
  "username": "<browserstack_username>",
  "key": "browserstack_key"
}
```
