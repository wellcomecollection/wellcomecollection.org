## Purpose
To be able to express a list of date ranges as a single, relevant date range
for people to be able to get a snapshot of an event.

### How do we do this?
We display the earliest, future date, which would be most relevant to a user
trying to make a decision on whether they would like to attend an event.

If this isn't available, we use the latest possible date.

This is usually used in conjunction with a link to view the full list of date
ranges.
