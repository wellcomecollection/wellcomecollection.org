/** Given a list of ranges, returns the first which ends on or after the given
 * date.
 *
 * This is best explained with an example.  Suppose we have an event that repeats
 * across three months: in September, October, and November.  Then it would have
 * three date ranges:
 *
 *    [
 *      { start: 1 Sept @ 9am, end: 1 Sept @ 10am },
 *      { start: 1 Oct  @ 9am, end: 1 Oct  @ 10am }
 *      { start: 1 Nov  @ 9am, end: 1 Nov  @ 10am }
 *    ]
 *
 * On the event page, we can display the full list of dates, but in certain contexts
 * (e.g. event promo cards, the event header) we can only show a single range.
 * This function chooses a suitable snapshot of an event.
 *
 *    - If we're on the event page, we want to highlight the next time this event
 *      is happening.  If today is August, we'd show the event in September.
 *      If today is mid-September, we'd show the event in October.
 *
 *    - On the what's on page, we group events by month, so we show the first event
 *      happening in each month.  If somebody is looking at the October tab, we show
 *      the event in October.  If it's the November tab, it's the November event.
