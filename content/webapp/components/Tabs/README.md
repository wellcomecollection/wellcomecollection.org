## Purpose
To navigate through related sections within a set of results.

### Default
`Tabs.Default` uses real tab behaviour where clicking a tab will swap out the content of the tabpanel underneath.

### Links
`Tabs.Links` uses the same styled-components as `Tabs.Default`, but the tabs function as anchors which link to a new page.
