## Purpose
To navigate through related sections within a set of results.

### Default
`Tabs.Tab` uses real tab behaviour where clicking a tab will swap out the content of the tabpanel underneath.

### Links
`Tabs.Anchor` uses the same styled-components as `Tabs.Tab`, but the tabs function as anchors which link to a new page.
