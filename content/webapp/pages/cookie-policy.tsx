                you will need to make separate choices in relation to the

              <h3>What are cookies?</h3>
              <p>
                Like most organisations, Wellcome uses cookies, and similar
                technologies such as tracking pixels (referred to in this policy
                together as &quot;cookies&quot;), to capture information about
                our website users (referred to as &quot;you&quot;). A cookie is
                a small file of letters and numbers that is downloaded onto your
                computer or device by a website, stored and used to send
                information back to that website.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cookies help to make websites work. They can also improve the
                performance of a site and some provide information to the owners
                of the site.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cookies do not store or collect information about you like your
                name. But they do collect information that relates to, for
                example, the devices you use to access the internet and your
                browsing history.

              <h3>What cookies do we use?</h3>
              <p>
                Cookies that measure website use: these allow us to count your
                visits to the website, and to see how you move around it. This
                helps us to provide you with a good experience while you browse,
                for example by helping to make sure you can find what you need.

                campaigns.
