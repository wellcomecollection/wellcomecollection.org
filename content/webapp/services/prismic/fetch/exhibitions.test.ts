  // Implementation note: this test queries Prismic directly.
  //
  // In general we don't want to rely on external resources in our tests, because
  // they can introduce slow and flaky tests.  In this case it's a reasonable cost,
  // because getting the display of exhibitions right on closing date is:
  //
  //    1. Very important
  //    2. Something we've had issues with in the past
  //    3. Difficult to test without actually making the Prismic query
  //
  // We should be conservative about adding more tests here because of the drawbacks,
  // but having _a_ safety net for this test case is worthwhile imo.
