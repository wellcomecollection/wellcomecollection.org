# Cache

We use CloudFront for the cache of wellcomecollection.org.

## lambda@edge

### [Redirector](./edge_lambdas/src/redirector.test.ts)

Redirects traffic at the edge, mitigating against any latency of having to route to a service.

The list is controlled via [a static map of URLs](./edge_lambdas/src/redirects.ts).

We don't control marketing URLs or alias URLs here. Marketing URLs are generally best handled with a
link shortener for tracking etc. Alias URLs, e.g. `/whats-on` are managed with the
[routing of the relevant application](https://github.com/wellcomecollection/wellcomecollection.org/blob/main/content/webapp/server.ts).

`redirector` runs @ the `origin-request` of [the lambda@edgfe lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-edge.html).

#### Add a redirect

Add the source relative URL and the target in [our static map of URLs](./edge_lambdas/src/redirects.ts).

Create a PR with this change, and once merged and built, run `terraform plan` and if it looks good, `terraform apply`.

Test your redirection in staging after a few minutes. Cache might need to be cleared.

If that works, you'll need to change the edge lambda versions in our [locals file](./locals.tf). 
You can find that version number in the Lambda AWS app.

Once that has been merged and built, you'll need to reapply Terraform.

### [Toggler](./edge_lambdas/src/toggler.test.ts) (A/B testing)

Randomly assign people into A/B buckets against a `key` that is then available to our webapps.

We do this by setting a `toggle_{key}=true|false` that is then read via the standard toggles method.

    Lambda_origin_request->>Origin: append x-toggled header
end
Origin->>Lambda_origin_response: response
alt has x-toggled header
    Lambda_origin_response->>End_user: send Set-cookie header to x-toggled
end
```

`toggler` runs @ the `origin-request` and `origin-response` of [the lambda@edgfe lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-edge.html).
