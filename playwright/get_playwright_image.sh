# The Docker image we use for Playwright testing is quite large and takes
# a while to build (~3m), but doesn't change that much -- it's self-contained
# and only needs to change when we add new tests.
#
# To save us building it every time we use it, this script caches built
# images in an ECR repo.
#
# In particular, it pushes new Docker images with two tags:
#
#   - latest
#   - the Git commit ref
#
# so downstream builds can just pull "weco/playwright:latest", and this
# script makes sure that tag always reflects the latest copy of these tests.
